The notes here help organize and manage records of information from online courses, books, projects or professional life experiences. The notes also aids my memory. Being active and repetitive learner helps the brain processing information. Getting hands dirty with labs and projects also develops a robust understanding. 

Later when there is a situation where recollection of knowledge is required, these notes will help me brush up to regain the knowledge instead of re-read a large amount of information to re-construct ideas and concepts. 

These notes are prepared mainly on the MOOC and projects, at the same time some mathematics references are included as necessary background for myself. I try to conduct them in a way that anyone in data science & analytics field can also use them as a reference material. Hope they could help you as well.
